# **Automating Multitrack Mixing with Tonn API and DAWProject: A Guide for Developers**

## **Introduction**

In modern music production, automation is key. Whether youâ€™re developing a DAW-integrated tool, running a music tech startup, or streamlining workflows for independent producers, automating the mixing process can save countless hours. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the **Tonn API** to retrieve a mix preview, download stems, apply processing, and format them for **Bitwig Studio and PreSonus Studio One**â€”all programmatically.

What makes this particularly powerful is how **Tonn API integrates seamlessly with** [DAWProject-py](https://github.com/bitwig/dawproject-py), an open-source project that allows for structured export to DAWs. This means that, in just a few steps, you can take your audio, apply mix settings like **EQ, Compression, Gain, and Panning**, and generate a DAW session file that loads everything into your preferred environment.

This is a **simple example**, but it highlights the potential for fully automated, API-driven mixing workflowsâ€”something that can **revolutionize** audio production tools. For a more detailed example check out the GitHub repository.

## **What Youâ€™ll Learn**

- How to **retrieve a mix preview** from the Tonn API
- How to **download and process multitrack audio files**
- How to **apply gain, EQ, and compression settings** programmatically
- How to **export directly to DAWs** using **DAWProject-py**
- How to **handle network errors and retries gracefully**

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before diving into the code, ensure you have:

- Python 3 installed
- The following dependencies installed via `pip`:
  ```sh
  pip install requests soundfile numpy
  ```
- An **API key** from [Tonn Portal](https://tonn-portal.roexaudio.com)
- Bitwig Studio or PreSonus Studio One (optional, but recommended for testing project files)
- **Access to a cloud storage bucket to store demo audio files** (Tonn API requires audio files to be stored in a bucket before processing)

---

## **1. Setting Up API Communication**

The Tonn API acts as the backbone of this process, allowing us to send **multitrack audio** for automated mixing and retrieve the processed output. To start, letâ€™s define some constants for interacting with the API:

```python
import time
import requests
import json
import os
import soundfile as sf

# Base API endpoint for Tonn
BASE_URL = "https://tonn.roexaudio.com"

# Retry settings for API calls
MAX_RETRIES = 3
RETRY_DELAY = 2  # seconds

API_KEY = "go to https://tonn-portal.roexaudio.com to get one"
```

Weâ€™ll use `requests` to interact with the API, ensuring that we handle failures gracefully with **retry mechanisms**.

---

## **2. Downloading Multitrack Audio Files**

Before processing, we need to fetch the **original stems** that will be used for the mix. Our function downloads these files while handling errors and retries.

```python
def download_audio(file_name, url, output_dir="audio_in"):
    """
    Downloads an audio file from the given URL and saves it locally.
    """
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    local_filename = os.path.join(output_dir, file_name)
    
    for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):
        try:
            print(f"Downloading {file_name} (Attempt {attempt + 1})...")
            response = requests.get(url, stream=True, timeout=10)
            response.raise_for_status()

            with open(local_filename, "wb") as file:
                for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
                    file.write(chunk)
            
            print(f"Successfully downloaded {file_name}")
            return local_filename
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error downloading {file_name}: {e}")
            if attempt < MAX_RETRIES - 1:
                time.sleep(RETRY_DELAY ** (attempt + 1))
            else:
                print(f"Failed to download {file_name} after {MAX_RETRIES} attempts.")
                return None
```
We apply exponential backoff ```(RETRY_DELAY ** (attempt + 1))``` to avoid overloading the API with repeated requests.

---

## **3. Retrieving and Polling the Mix Preview**

Once we submit our multitrack audio to the Tonn API, we must poll for the preview mix until itâ€™s ready. The following function repeatedly checks the API and retrieves the processed mix when available:

```python
def poll_preview_mix(task_id, headers, max_attempts=30, poll_interval=5):
    """
    Polls the API until the preview mix is ready.
    """
    retrieve_url = f"{BASE_URL}/retrievepreviewmix"
    retrieve_payload = {"multitrackData": {"multitrackTaskId": task_id, "retrieveFXSettings": True}}
    
    print("Polling for the preview mix...")
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        response = requests.post(retrieve_url, json=retrieve_payload, headers=headers)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            results = response.json().get("previewMixTaskResults", {})
            if results.get("status") == "MIX_TASK_PREVIEW_COMPLETED":
                print("Preview mix is ready!")
                return results
        elif response.status_code == 202:
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1}: Still processing...")
        else:
            print("Unexpected error while polling.")
            return None

        time.sleep(poll_interval)
    
    print("Mix preview was not available after polling. Try again later.")
    return None
```

## **4. Processing Audio: Gain, EQ, and Compression**

Once we have the mix output settings, we apply **gain adjustments, equalization, and compression**.

```python
def format_audio_tracks_for_daw(mix_output_settings, downloaded_files):
    """
    Applies mix settings (gain, EQ, compression) to each track.
    """
    audio_tracks = []
    
    for track_name, settings in mix_output_settings.items():
        file_path = downloaded_files.get(track_name)
        if not file_path:
            continue

        audio_x, sr = sf.read(file_path, dtype="float32")
        audio_x *= settings["gain_settings"]["initial_gain"]
        sf.write(file_path, audio_x, sr)

        audio_tracks.append({
            "file_path": file_path,
            "gain": settings["gain_settings"]["gain_amplitude"],
            "eq_settings": settings.get("eq_settings", []),
            "compressor_settings": settings.get("drc_settings", {})
        })
    
    return audio_tracks
```

---

## **5. Exporting to Bitwig Studio and PreSonus Studio One**

We format our processed tracks and **automatically create a DAW project** using DAWProject-py.

```python
import createBitwigProject

def create_bitwig_project(audio_tracks):
    createBitwigProject.create_project_with_audio_tracks(audio_tracks)
```
This step ensures seamless DAW integration, making our automated mixing process immediately usable for further production and tweaking.
